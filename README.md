# Contacts App

A basic application that displays contacts from a freely available API. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and double click the `index.html` file. Make sure you have an active internet connection. 


## Built With

While mostly everything is built from scratch, I've used the [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) as a base. Though
I've removed any JavaScript or CSS framework that came build with it. 

The API for generating random users is from [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)


## Thoughts

This was the first time I've created a webapp without a JS and CSS framework.  I've usually used [Yeoman] in the past to quickly prototype an app. 
It took me creating this project to realize how much JS/CSS frameworks abstract way, and how easy it makes coding. I really enjoyed this project, but it feels so incomplete. 
There are so many things I would like to add/implement, but I feel I've already delayed a bit too much.
